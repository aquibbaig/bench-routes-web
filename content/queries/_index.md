2. Does the user have to import the package in the software?
- ***Ans.** No, as mentioned in explanation, bench-routes is a GUI tool, the user has to provide the IP address and the routes of the server In the GUI interface.*

3. Is there any automation for finding out routes, as many sophisticated applications contain millions of routes in a single web-application?
- ***Ans.** We plan a native mini-package of every possible language which would contain a fixed hidden route. The programmer will have to pass an array of strings to the imported function. When bench-routes is initiated, as the IP address is provided, the service will automatically ping the fixed hidden route and get the list of routes available and initiate the testing and monitoring process on it.*
